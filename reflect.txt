1. Do you have any previous programming experience? If so, what language(s)? If not, what are your initial 
thoughts about the C language and this course? 

	Yes, I already have 3-year experiences in programming, especially Python. I also go through OOP, DSA,...
However, this is a wonderful chance for me to review my basic knowledge again.

2. Describe your understanding of the compiling process of turning a C text file into an executable program.
	
	There are 4 steps in compiling process: pre-processing, compilation, assembly, linking. 
	The first step is pre-processing, basic understand is the compiler make the code more clearly as removal comments, 
expansion of included files, compilation of conditional,...
	The second step  is about compile from C to assemble language and containing machine code specific to the target 
architecture but not yet executable.
	The third step is about converting assembly language to machine language
	The final step is about linking object files with libraries, or linking all the functions together.
	 
3. What do you hope to achieve in this course? Describe your goals and expectations.
	I want to review all my basic knowledge to have better preparation for interview. Because these knowledges are necessary and must-needed for porgrammer who want to go further. My goals are get job in this country, I already did some project and also looking for job in this momment.
