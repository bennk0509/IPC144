1. You learned several iteration constructs in the previous two weeks (do-while, while, for). In this workshop, you had 
to validate the rating values entered by the user. Can you use the “for” iteration construct to do that? Why? 

In this case, we can't use for loop to validate the rating values entered by the user 
because we don't know how many times the user will enter the rating values. The for loop is used when we know the number of iterations.

2. You can print the month in part 2 of this workshop using two different selection constructs; which one did you 
select? Why? 

I selected the switch-case statement to print the month because it is more efficient and easier to read 
than the if-else statement. The switch-case statement is used when we have multiple conditions to check.
 
3. Why do we try to use variables and macros to represent information rather than hardcode “magic” numbers 
(constant literals)?  Using the details of this workshop, describe at least three advantages this provides us. 

Because it makes the code more readble, maintainable and reusable.
- Readability: Using variables and macros to represent information makes the code more readable. 
  It is easier to understand the code when we use variables and macros instead of hardcoding the values.
- Maintainability: If we need to change the value, we only need to change it in one place.
- Reusability: We can reuse the variables and macros in other parts of the code.
