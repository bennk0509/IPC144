1. After using different types of iteration constructs in this workshop, you learn that you can use any of the 
iteration constructs do/while, while or for to solve a programming task. Compare the use of the while construct 
and the do/while construct in getting and evaluating the user’s input. Explain. 
 
2. In this workshop, you used “if” optional path constructs and “if/else if” alternative path logic. Give an example 
from the workshop where using the “if/else if” alternative path construct is more efficient than the “if” optional 
path.  
3. With the completion of this workshop, you must have begun to appreciate why code formatting is important. 
Explain how you made your code – especially the iteration and selection logic parts – easy to read and maintain.
